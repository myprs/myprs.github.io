Welcome. I am amazed to announce the launch of my website. 

Over time I always felt the urge to share things I figure out during my geek life. I always felt uncomfortable to just fire up google, every time I had some issues to resolve and just consuming the work of others. This is the start for me to be able to share. I hope to produce some content that will be of some use to others.  <!--more-->

When it came to setting up a website I always was hesitant to have all this stuff running: web server, database, some language like php, virtual server or buying some web hosting packages and having to decide what system to run on. For most of the common, recommended CMS you can see the articles on security issues and warnings to update and install patches popping up on a regular basis. I didn't feel that this whole effort was worth it, just to run a little blog.

Now I am really excited that I did find a setup which suits my needs. [Jekyll][jekyll] is an "offline CMS" which can be installed on my local machine. It's plain textfile and you write [markdown][markdown] or some other [markup][markup], which will be converted to html. To me as a longtime wiki author, this was what I wanted. And no Database needed! Great! You add new content by creating a new file at the right place and fill it with simple markup. That's it.

Next advantage: As this is plain text, you can version your site in [git]. As git is an [distributed-cvs] you can easily distribute copies and use them as backups, including you version history in a efficient manner. Super handy!

Last but not least I did figure out that if I use [GitHub][github] as the place to host my repository, it integrates well with [jekyll] and I can host my site on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] easily. This will give me the advantages of being hosted on a big site, using a CDN.

And here we are! What else should I ask for. I am super happy!
